# Compiler

Implement a μGo programming language compiler step by step by Lex and Yacc and several compiler-related algorithms (e.g. first, follow set, LR(1) goto and closure function) by C.

### HW1 Lexical Definition

A scanner for the μGo language with lex

### HW2 Syntactic and Semantic Definitions for μGo

The parser for the μGo language that supports print IO, arithmetic operations and some basic constructs for μGo

### HW3 μGO Compiler for Java Assembly Code Generation

Generate Java assembly code (for Java Virtual Machines) of the given μGO program. The generated code will then be translated to the Java bytecode by the Java assembler, Jasmin. The generated Java bytecode would be run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) successfully.
